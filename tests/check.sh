Usage: check.sh [all | lint | behaviour]

  check.sh all         both halves, in order (the default)
  check.sh lint        the vendored checkers, the workflows, the flake and the documents
  check.sh behaviour   the service's suite, against stand-ins for IMAP and SMTP

Exit codes:
  0  everything holds
  1  a check found something
  2  usage, or a tool the gate needs is missing
